# Common Winning Paths Ascension 20 (Aggregated) | Analyzing Slay the Spire Data

For this project, Iâ€™ll share with you my analysis on Common Paths of the Slay the Spire game. I'll use the Ascension 20 winning complete runs data and aggregate total selected locations to plot the distribution of selected locations by most players. Also, this project will employ segmentation to test and have a distinct common paths for each character. The resulting charts will help most players have a general strategy on their target number of selected locations for their case.
